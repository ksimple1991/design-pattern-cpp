### Observer
Observer defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Then pattern has behavioral purpos and applies to the objects.

### When to use
- when an abstaction has two aspects, one dependent on the other
- when a change to one object requires changing other, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed
- when an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are
